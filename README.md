# Reddit Bot

This is an extremely simple reddit bot which can either stream posts from a given sub-reddit or collect `x` amount of posts from another.


## Dependancies

Please see `requirements.txt` file.

## How-To:

1. Enter your credentials into the `reddit` object in either `ge6t_posts.py` or `reddit_stream.py`.
2. Enjoy!

## Future:

I would like to make this bot react to incoming stream messages from a given sub-reddit.
